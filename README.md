A robust and scalable full-stack authentication system built with a modern, decoupled architecture. This project serves as a foundational template for secure web applications, featuring a Node.js backend and a React frontend.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Secure User Authentication**: Complete flow for user registration and login.
- **JWT-based Security**: Session management using secure, `httpOnly` cookies containing JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
- **Password Hashing**: User passwords are salted and hashed using `bcryptjs`, never stored in plaintext.
- **Decoupled Architecture**: A clear separation between the backend REST API and the frontend client application.
- **Responsive UI**: A clean, responsive interface built with React and styled with TailwindCSS, providing a seamless experience on desktop, tablet, and mobile.
- **Robust Validation**: Strong, schema-based input validation on the backend using `Zod`.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing.

### üìã Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following tools installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v20.x or higher is recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (usually comes with Node.js)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) (running as a service)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### ‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Setup

#### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone this repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone <your-github-repo-url>
cd <project-folder-name>
Use code with caution.
2. Configure the Database (PostgreSQL)
You need to create a dedicated user and database for the application.
Connect to PostgreSQL as a superuser (e.g., postgres).
Generated bash
psql -U postgres
Use code with caution.
Bash
Run the following SQL commands:
Generated sql
-- Create a new user for the application. Replace 'mysecretpassword' with a strong password.
CREATE USER app_user WITH PASSWORD 'mysecretpassword';

-- Create the database.
CREATE DATABASE auth_app;

-- Grant all privileges on the new database to the new user.
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE auth_app TO app_user;

-- Connect to the new database to enable extensions
\c auth_app

-- Enable the pgcrypto extension required for UUID generation.
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "pgcrypto";

-- Exit psql
\q
Use code with caution.
SQL
3. Configure Environment Variables
The backend requires a .env file with credentials and secrets.
Navigate to the backend directory.
Create a .env file by copying the example file.
Generated bash
cd backend
cp .env.example .env
Use code with caution.
Bash
Open the newly created backend/.env file and fill in the required values.
Generated env
# Application Port
PORT=3001

# Database Connection
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_USER=app_user
DB_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword
DB_NAME=auth_app

# JWT Secret - Use a long, random, and strong string for this!
JWT_SECRET=a_very_strong_and_long_secret_key_for_jwt_that_is_not_this_one

# Frontend URL (for CORS)
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5174
Use code with caution.
Env
üèÉ Running the Application
You'll need two separate terminal windows to run the backend and frontend concurrently.
Terminal 1: Start the Backend Server
Generated bash
# Navigate to the backend directory
cd backend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
Use code with caution.
Bash
The backend API will now be running on http://localhost:3001. The server will also attempt to create the users table in the database if it doesn't exist.
Terminal 2: Start the Frontend Client
Generated bash
# Navigate to the frontend directory
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
Use code with caution.
Bash
The React application will now be running on http://localhost:5174 (or the next available port).
You can now open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:5174 to use the application!
